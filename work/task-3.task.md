## Description
The overlay manager exists but is not started.

- In discovery_loop or a new dedicated loop, create TUN, start OverlayNetwork (which starts stack + DNS)
- Feed updates from network service discovery (DEVENV_TUNNEL) to the overlay
- Handle start/stop, graceful shutdown
- Support foreground mode and daemon mode
- Coordinate with existing cloud tunnel if both active

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Daemon starts the virtual stack when enabled
- [ ] Services with DEVENV_TUNNEL are registered in overlay
- [ ] Stack shuts down cleanly
- [ ] No breakage to existing DEVENV_TUNNEL flow
