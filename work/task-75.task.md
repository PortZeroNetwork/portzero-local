Client side of the Review Records feature on portzero.cloud:

- `portzero review [--base <ref>] [--domain <domain>] [--project <name>] [--open]`
  uploads the branch's commits + diff as a review record (POST /review-records/),
  reporting any feedback threads advanced by `Fixes PZ-<n>` commit messages.
- MCP tools `list_feedback` and `propose_fix` let AI coding agents read
  reviewer feedback threads and propose fixes; the MCP server now passes
  `tools/call` arguments through to tools.
- Docs: docs/review-records.md, docs/mcp.md updates.
