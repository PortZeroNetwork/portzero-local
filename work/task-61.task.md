`portzero wait MYTUNNEL.portzero.local [--healthy] [--timeout <secs>]` blocks
until the tunnel exists; with `--healthy` (or when the backing endpoint declares
PZ_HEALTH_PATH) it also polls the health path until it returns 2xx.

The argument is the tunnel domain — portzero has no service concept and the
tunnel name is the only identity.

Consumers: CD smoke gates in GitHub Actions, Playwright `webServer` blocks
(`command: 'docker compose up -d && portzero wait web.myapp.portzero.local'`),
and the Playwright fixture package.

Design note: a paused tunnel (edge-only pause, cloud-side feature) must be
distinguishable from a dead one; wait should fail on dead and report paused
distinctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Exits 0 when tunnel is up (and healthy, if requested); nonzero on timeout with a clear message
- [ ] Works for Local and Cloud tunnels
- [ ] `--timeout` with a sensible default
- [ ] Documented with a Playwright webServer example
