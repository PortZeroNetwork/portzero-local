## Description
The current `stack.rs` is a stub. Implement the real async packet-routing loop:

- Read raw L3 packets from TUN
- Feed to smoltcp Interface + SocketSet
- Accept TCP on virtual IPs + service ports
- On established connections, proxy payload bidirectionally to `tokio::net::TcpStream` to the real ephemeral backend
- Proper state management, close handling, buffering
- Use smoltcp for all TCP handshake/state, never OS sockets for the client side

Include unit tests with mock devices if possible. Ensure it handles multiple services/connections.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connections to VIP:port establish via smoltcp
- [ ] Data flows correctly to real backend and back
- [ ] Graceful shutdown and error handling
- [ ] Works with the existing ServiceTable updates
