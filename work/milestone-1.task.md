# Virtual Overlay Network v0.2

Complete the implementation of the Port 0 + Virtual Overlay Network so that `DEVENV_TUNNEL=foo` + port 0 bindings allow seamless access via `foo.devenv.local` without any port conflicts, even across multiple worktrees.

## Goals
- Full end-to-end packet flow through TUN + smoltcp
- Scoped DNS only for *.devenv.local
- Robust discovery for both native processes and Docker (with/without compose)
- Visibility and helpful errors for misconfigurations and legacy usage
- Platform support and security

See child tasks for breakdown.
