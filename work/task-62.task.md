Plumbing so a test process can learn a tunnel's URL:

- `portzero url MYTUNNEL.portzero.local` prints the resolved URL (scheme, host, port).
- `portzero env` prints export lines for all discovered tunnels;
  `portzero env --github` appends to `$GITHUB_ENV` in Actions.

This is the escape hatch for non-Playwright consumers; the Playwright fixture
package talks to the daemon directly and is the preferred integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `portzero url` prints exactly the URL on stdout (script-safe)
- [ ] `portzero env --github` works in a GitHub Actions job
- [ ] Errors clearly when the tunnel does not exist
