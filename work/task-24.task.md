## Context

macOS `utun` devices prepend a **4-byte address-family header** (`AF_INET` =
`0x00000002`, big-endian) to every L3 packet on read, and expect the same
header prepended on write. smoltcp expects a bare IP packet starting with the
version nibble.

`net/stack.rs` reads into a `STACK_MTU + 4` buffer (so someone anticipated the
header) but then forwards `buf[..n]` straight into the stack with no stripping,
and the writer path doesn't prepend the header. Whether this is a real bug
depends on how the `tun` crate (v0.6.1) handles the header on macOS — it may or
may not strip it for us. If unhandled, the overlay **compiles and resolves but
carries no traffic** on macOS (a resolve-but-hang in [[[task-22](../work/task-22.task.md)]] is the tell).

## CONFIRMED (2026-06-23) — this is the active data-path bug

The [[[task-22](../work/task-22.task.md)]] re-run (after [[[task-31](../work/task-31.task.md)]] + [[[task-33](../work/task-33.task.md)]] + [[[task-34](../work/task-34.task.md)]]) reaches
the resolve-but-hang: `hello.devenv.local` resolves to its VIP `10.254.0.2` and
`status` shows the route, but `curl http://hello.devenv.local:8080/` connects to
`10.254.0.2:8080` and **times out after 8s** — no traffic crosses the overlay.

Root cause verified by reading the crate source: `tun` 0.6.1's macOS backend
(`platform/posix/fd.rs` `Fd::read`/`Fd::write`) does raw `libc::read`/`write` on
the utun fd with **no header handling**. macOS utun prepends a 4-byte
address-family header (`00 00 00 02` = `AF_INET`, big-endian) on every read and
REQUIRES it on every write. So:

- **read:** `stack.rs` feeds `[00 00 00 02][IP…]` to smoltcp, which reads the
  first nibble `0x0` as IP version 0 → drops the SYN.
- **write:** smoltcp's bare IP packet is written with no AF header → the kernel
  rejects/misroutes it.

## Approach

- Add the macOS utun 4-byte header handling at the TUN boundary in
  `net/tun_device.rs` (preferred — keeps `stack.rs` platform-agnostic): on macOS,
  `TunReader::read` strips the leading 4 bytes before returning the IP packet,
  and `TunWriter::write` prepends the 4-byte AF header. Choose the family from
  the IP version nibble of the outgoing packet: IPv4 (`0x4…`) → `AF_INET`
  (`00 00 00 02`); IPv6 (`0x6…`) → `AF_INET6` (`00 00 00 1E`). The header is a
  big-endian `u32` protocol family.
- Keep **Linux byte-for-byte unchanged** (no header there — passthrough).
- Make the strip/prepend logic pure where possible and unit-test it (header
  bytes in/out) so it's verifiable without root.

Done when:

- [x] macOS `curl http://hello.devenv.local:8080/` returns a real response body
- [x] Header strip-on-read / prepend-on-write is macOS-scoped; Linux untouched
- [x] Unit test covers the header add/strip (incl. IPv4 vs IPv6 family byte)
- [x] Verified by a privileged [[[task-22](../work/task-22.task.md)]] re-run (curl carries traffic)

## Verified (run 2026-06-23, macOS, as root)

A temporary packet trace at the TUN boundary (since removed) captured a full,
successful HTTP transaction over the overlay:

```
RX 64  raw_head=[00,00,00,02, 45,00,00,40]  SYN in  (header stripped → ip0=0x45)
TX 52                                        SYN-ACK out
RX 40                                        ACK (handshake complete)
RX 126                                       GET request
TX 40 / TX 97                                ACK + 97-byte HTTP response
RX 40 / RX 40 / TX 40                        response ACKed, clean FIN/close
```

The macOS utun 4-byte AF header (`00 00 00 02` = AF_INET) is correctly stripped
on read and prepended on write, so smoltcp sees valid IPv4 and the proxy carries
traffic **both ways** (full handshake + bidirectional data + clean close). The
earlier "resolve-but-hang" timeouts were a stale binary built before this fix.

CORRECTION: the bytes in that transaction turned out to be an SSH banner, not
the example body — the overlay was proxying to the wrong backend (port 22) due
to a separate lsof discovery bug ([[[task-36](../work/task-36.task.md)]]). That does NOT affect this
ticket: the utun header handling is proven correct by the bidirectional TCP
flow. The end-to-end "returns the example body" confirmation lands once
[[[task-36](../work/task-36.task.md)]] is verified.
