## Description
Fuzzy UX to help migrate and catch errors:

- Periodically scan for processes listening on common ports (or service_ports of known overlays)
- When detected, use process cwd to determine worktree context; compare to registered service
- For connections: inspect source port (RemotePort), lookup owning process, check its cwd/git context
- Show tray / log / status messages with helpful guidance
- Detect docker container start failures due to port bind conflicts
- Optionally auto-suggest or watch for direct localhost access

Also watch for bind attempts on ports we're "managing".

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Detects and reports legacy listeners with context
- [ ] Attributes connections via port to processes
- [ ] Helpful messages for Docker conflicts
- [ ] Works cross-platform (best effort)
