//! PortZero system-tray companion library.
//!
//! A small, opt-in GUI companion (deliberately separate from the headless
//! daemon) that gives the daemon a face in the menu bar / system tray:
//!
//! - A green / amber / red status dot reflecting daemon and tunnel health, read
//!   entirely from the daemon's on-disk state so it works even when the daemon
//!   is **down** — the case a new user is most likely to hit.
//! - If the daemon isn't running when the tray starts, it launches it once
//!   (`portzero start`), and offers Start / Restart / Stop from the menu.
//! - A browsable list of local and cloud tunnels (with their http/https scheme),
//!   a global "enable HTTPS for HTTP tunnels" toggle, and any current issues.
//!
//! The menu is built once in [`menu`] and used unchanged on every platform, so
//! it stays identical across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
